Dataflow Debug and Optimization (Dataflow Viewer and Deadlock Prevention)
## Introduction
This project follows [Xilinx Vitis Tutorials](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials/tree/2022.1/Hardware_Acceleration/Feature_Tutorials/03-dataflow_debug_and_optimization) for dataflow debug and optimization.  
There are two parts in the project:  
1._How to use **Dataflow Viewer**_
2._How to **detect deadlocks** and make **FIFO sizing**_
### Files
In the file **report.pdf** there are descriptions of experiments.  
In the folder **\dataflow** there is a complete, finished project for Dataflow Viewer experiments.  
In the folder **\deadlock** there is a complete, finished project for deadlock detection and FIFO sizing experiments.
### Building
For the two experiments, we use different building processes. If you want to open the project, please download the whole folder and:  
1. For **Dataflow Viewer** experiment, please select folder **/dataflow** as project folder.  
2. For **FIFO Sizing and Deadlocks** experiment, please select folder **/deadlock/proj** as project folder.
## Dataflow Viewer
This part follows [Dataflow Viewer and the basics](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials/blob/2022.1/Hardware_Acceleration/Feature_Tutorials/03-dataflow_debug_and_optimization/dataflow_viewer.md).  
We can learn how to use Dataflow Viewer in this part.
## Deadlocks and FIFO Sizing
This part follows [FIFO Sizing and Deadlocks](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials/blob/2022.1/Hardware_Acceleration/Feature_Tutorials/03-dataflow_debug_and_optimization/fifo_sizing_and_deadlocks.md).  
We can learn how to detect deadlocks and how to use FIFO sizing methods to solve deadlocks.
